<p> Hello, it's me
    <div> I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
    To go over everything
    They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
    Hello, can you hear me?</div>
    <p>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
    When we were younger and free
    I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
    There's such a difference between us
    And a million miles</p>
    <span>Hello from the other side
    I must've called a thousand times
    To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
    But when I call,</span> you never seem to be home
    Hello from the outside
    At least I can say that I've tried
    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
   <div>
    <p><b>Hello, how are you?</b></p> 
    <p><i>It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
    I hope that you're well</i></p>
   </div>
    Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
    It's no secret that the both of us
    Are running out of time </p>
</body>
